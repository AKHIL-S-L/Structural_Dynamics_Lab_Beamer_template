	abstract = {A debated issue, in applications of Eringen's nonlocal model of elasticity to nanobeams, is the paradox concerning the solution of simple beam problems, such as the cantilever under end-point loading. In the adopted nonlocal model, the bending field is expressed as convolution of elastic curvature with a smoothing kernel. The inversion of the nonlocal elastic law leads to solution of a Fredholm integral equation of the first kind. It is here shown that this problem admits a unique solution or no solution at all, depending on whether the bending field fulfils constitutive boundary conditions or not. Paradoxical results found in solving nonlocal elastostatic problems of simple beams are shown to stem from incompatibility between the constitutive boundary conditions and equilibrium conditions imposed on the bending field. The conclusion is that existence of a solution of nonlocal beam elastostatic problems is an exception, the rule being non-existence for problems of applicative interest. Numerical evaluations reported in the literature hide or shadow this conclusion since nodal forces expressing the elastic response are not checked against equilibrium under the prescribed data. The cantilever problem is investigated as case study and analytically solved to exemplify the matter.}

	abstract = {Nonlocal elastic models have attracted an increasing amount of attention in the past years, due to the promising feature of providing a viable simulation for scale effects in nano-structures and especially in nano-beams designed for use as actuators or sensors. In adapting Eringenâ€™s nonlocal model of elasticity to flexure of nano-beams, the bending field is expressed as convolution between the elastic curvature field and an averaging kernel. Basic difficulties are involved in this approach due to conflicting requirements imposed on the bending field by equilibrium on one hand and by constitutive conditions on the other one. In the newly proposed constitutive theory the bending field is placed in the proper position of input variable, giving to the elastic curvature field the role of output of the constitutive law, evaluated by convolution between the bending field and an averaging kernel. Conflicting restrictions on the bending field are thus eliminated and existence and uniqueness of the solution are assured under any data. Equivalence between integral and differential constitutive relations is proven to hold for nonlocal laws with a special kernel, under constitutive boundary conditions stemming naturally from the integral relation. When compared with the local limit, a stiffer elastic response is evaluated by the stress-driven nonlocal model, due to normalisation of the kernel. The theory provides an effective methodology for investigating small scale effects in nanobeams, by well-posed problems.}
